## Usage

The Waveshare 1.28" LCD ESP32-S3 board will be used in Project Goose to create a modular control system for the robot joints. Each joint will have one board, allowing for extensibility and future enhancements in robotics projects.

### Single Servo Mode

In single servo mode, the board controls a single servo, providing precise control and feedback for the robot joint.

### Tandem Servo Mode

In tandem servo mode, the board controls two servos that are driven in opposite directions. This mode is useful for achieving 180-degree operation angles, where one servo moves forward while the other moves backward.

## Installation

1. Connect the Waveshare 1.28" LCD ESP32-S3 board to the robot joint using the 1.27mm pitch headers.
2. Configure the board for the desired operating mode (single servo or tandem servo).
3. Ensure proper power supply and signal connections as per the pinout diagram.

## Maintenance

- Regularly check the connections and ensure that the headers are securely attached.
- Keep the board clean and free from dust and debris.
- Update the firmware as needed to ensure optimal performance.

## Troubleshooting

- If the board is not responding, check the power supply and signal connections.
- Verify that the board is configured for the correct operating mode.
- Consult the Waveshare documentation for additional troubleshooting steps.
