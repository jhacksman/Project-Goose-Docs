# Waveshare Shield Requirements

## Overview
The Waveshare Shield is a companion board designed to interface with the Waveshare 1.28" LCD ESP32-S3 board. It will provide additional functionalities and connectivity options to support the operation of the robot arm in Project Goose.

## Components
1. **Waveshare 1.28" LCD ESP32-S3 Board**
   - 1.27mm pitch headers
   - 2x 20-pin headers for connection to the shield

2. **ACS712 Current Sensors**
   - Quantity: 2
   - Current rating: 5A each
   - Purpose: Measure current draw of servos

3. **Buck Converter**
   - Input voltage: 7.5V
   - Output voltage: 5V
   - Purpose: Step down voltage to power the Waveshare board and shield

4. **I2C Headers**
   - Purpose: Provide I2C connectivity for additional sensors and modules

5. **Common Ground**
   - Purpose: Ensure all components share a common electrical ground

## Electrical Characteristics
- **Input Voltage:** 7.5V from main PSU
- **Output Voltage:** 5V from buck converter
- **Current Handling:** Up to 5A per ACS712 sensor
- **Power Supply for Servos:** 7.5V, 5600mA per servo (tandem mode: 11.2A total)

## Physical Constraints
- **Board Size:** To be determined based on component layout
- **Header Placement:** Ensure proper alignment with Waveshare board headers
- **Mounting Holes:** Include mounting holes for secure attachment

## Functionalities
1. **Current Sensing:**
   - Measure current draw of servos using ACS712 sensors
   - Provide data for monitoring and safety

2. **Voltage Regulation:**
   - Step down 7.5V to 5V using buck converter
   - Power the Waveshare board and shield

3. **I2C Connectivity:**
   - Provide headers for connecting additional I2C sensors and modules

4. **Modularity:**
   - Support single servo mode and tandem servo mode
   - Allow for future expansion and customization

## Design Considerations
- **Thermal Management:** Ensure adequate cooling for components
- **Signal Integrity:** Minimize noise and interference in signal lines
- **Safety:** Include protection mechanisms for overcurrent and overvoltage conditions

## Next Steps
1. Create a schematic diagram based on the requirements outlined above.
2. Review the schematic for accuracy and completeness.
3. Proceed with PCB layout and prototyping.
