# Waveshare Shield Schematic Description

## Components and Connections Layout

### Components
1. **ACS712 Current Sensor Modules (2x)**
   - Sensor 1: ACS712-1
   - Sensor 2: ACS712-2

2. **Buck Converter**
   - Input Voltage: 7.5V
   - Output Voltage: 5V

3. **Servo Connectors**
   - Two sets of 3-pin Connectors: Power (7.5V), Ground, PWM Signal
   - Two sets of 1-pin Connectors: Position Feedback

4. **Waveshare Board Connectors**
   - 2x 20-pin Connectors
   - Pin Pitch: 1.27mm
   - Distance between connectors: 27.00mm (center to center)
   - Orientation: USB-C port at the top center

5. **I2C Headers**
   - SDA
   - SCL

6. **Common Ground**

### Connections
1. **Power Distribution**
   - 7.5V from power source to Buck Converter input
   - 5V from Buck Converter output to Waveshare board and ACS712 modules

2. **ACS712 Current Sensors**
   - 7.5V input to ACS712-1 sensor port
   - 7.5V input to ACS712-2 sensor port
   - Sensor output (0V to 2.5V) to Waveshare board analog input (ensure correct orientation)

3. **Servo Connectors**
   - Two sets of 3-pin Connectors:
     - Pin 1: Ground (black)
     - Pin 2: 7.5V Power (red)
     - Pin 3: PWM Signal (white, digital pin from Waveshare board)
   - Two sets of 1-pin Connectors:
     - Pin 1: Position Feedback (analog pin from Waveshare board)

4. **I2C Headers**
   - SDA to Waveshare board SDA pin
   - SCL to Waveshare board SCL pin

5. **Common Ground**
   - Connect all ground pins to a common ground plane

### Notes
- Ensure that the ACS712 sensors are correctly oriented to measure current flow in the desired direction.
- Verify the pinout and orientation of the 20-pin connectors on the Waveshare board once the details are confirmed.
- Double-check the connections for the servo connectors to ensure proper functionality.

## Next Steps
- Review the schematic draft with the user for accuracy and completeness.
- Proceed with the actual schematic drawing in KiCad based on the confirmed details.
- Finalize the PCB layout and prepare for prototyping.
